I serialize a package (RPackage) using Tonel library.
By sending me #directory message, I return a directory where the given package is stored.
I am useful for exchanging source code among users as the source code can be serialized (ZIP archive) and send to a user.
To obtain the ZIP archive, send me #zipFile message.
